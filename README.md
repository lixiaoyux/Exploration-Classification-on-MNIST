## Classification on MNIST

This includes several modules working on classification task on MNIST dataset. This is a basic project aiming to explore the precision of different methods used for classification.

### Content

#### 1. Logistic Regression



#### 2. Decision Tree



#### 3. Support Vector Machine



#### 4. K-Nearest Neighbor

as for distance, we use different metrics, e.g. 

##### (1) Euclidean

##### (2) Manhattan

##### (3) Chebyshev

##### (4) Cosine



#### 5. CNN

Before the task, we know that even if the simple and naive Convolution Neural Network can have a awesome performance on classification task.
